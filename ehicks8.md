I am a senior in computer science looking forward to Grad School at either UTK or The University of Utah.


Why would I be applying to The University of Utah? Well its rated as one of the top video game development colleges and my father went there as well. Building off that I worked on making a multiplayer demo game in Unreal Engine 4 last semester as part of Senior Design. It allowed the player to create and search for other game lobby’s through LAN connection or Steam’s Multiplayer API. A few days ago, I had a phone interview with a gaming company right outside of Atlanta for an internship there this summer. I know it is far fetched but if I could somehow work more on developing a game in Unreal Engine 4 (multiplayer would be a bonus) that would be really useful for my career path.
